# AGENTS.md – Strict Rules for AI Agents



**Purpose**: This file contains STRICT, ENFORCEABLE rules. Unlike `AI_GUIDELINES.md` (philosophy and best practices), this file is a CONTRACT that AI agents MUST follow. Violations MUST be reported to the user.



**Sync**: This file MUST be synced to all projects. When updating, sync to `~/Documents/kuro-rules` (master copy).



---



## RULE 1: Read Rules First – MANDATORY



### Rule

AI agents MUST read this file at the START of every session, BEFORE any other action.



### Verification

```

ACTION: Read AGENTS.md (this file) first

VERIFY: Confirm to user "I have read AGENTS.md and will enforce all rules"

```



### Enforcement

IF agent starts working without reading rules:

- STOP immediately

- READ AGENTS.md

- RESTART the task with rules in context



---



## RULE 2: Mom Test Gate – MANDATORY



### Rule

Before applying the Mom Test gate, the agent MUST ask: **"Quel type de projet s'agit-il ?"** and classify the work as:
- **Client-requested delivery**
- **Verified problem (already validated with evidence)**
- **Personal project**
- **Startup project (requires Mom Test)**

If the project is **client-requested**, a **verified problem**, or a **personal project**, Mom Test is **NOT required** (Rule 2 becomes **N/A**) and the agent must proceed with delivery/solutioning without initiating Mom Test artifacts.

Otherwise, the project CANNOT exceed 10% progress until Mom Test is COMPLETE. No production code allowed during Mom Test phase.



### Verification Checklist

Before ANY code implementation, VERIFY ALL of the following:



| Requirement | Verification Method |

|-------------|---------------------|

| Project type confirmed | Ask user and record: client-requested / verified problem / personal / startup |

| Mom Test required? | **If client-requested or verified problem: mark Rule 2 as N/A and skip the checks below** |

| Minimum 5 interviews | Check `mom_test_results.md` has 5+ interview entries |

| `mom_test_script.md` exists | File exists with EN/FR interview questions |

| `mom_test_results.md` exists | File exists with documented interviews |

| `decision.md` exists | File exists with Go/No-Go/Pivot justification |

| 3+ spontaneous mentions | Count in `mom_test_results.md` |

| 2+ solution seekers | Count in `mom_test_results.md` |



### Enforcement

```

IF project type is client-requested OR verified problem OR personal project:

  ACTION: Mark Rule 2 as N/A and proceed (no Mom Test artifacts required)

ELSE IF any checklist item is FALSE:

  ACTION: STOP implementation immediately

  ACTION: SET progress to 10% maximum

  ACTION: REPORT missing deliverables to user

  ACTION: COMPLETE missing deliverables before proceeding

  DO NOT: Write production code

  DO NOT: Create architecture documents beyond brainstorming

```

### Verification

```

BEFORE reporting progress:

  CALCULATE: Sum of completed components

  SUBTRACT: 10-15% for optimism bias

  VERIFY: Does this match reality?

  IF doubt: Subtract another 10%

```



### Enforcement

```

IF progress > actual completion:

  ACTION: Recalculate with pessimistic estimate

  ACTION: Document what's missing

  DO NOT: Inflate progress to make user happy

## RULE 17: Deep Understanding Before Phase Transition – MANDATORY



### Rule

Before transitioning to the next phase, the user MUST demonstrate deep understanding of what was created, including 2nd and 3rd order consequences.



### Requirements

1. **Explain the mechanism**: How does it work under the hood?

2. **2nd order consequences**: What happens if this is used in production? What edge cases emerge?

3. **3rd order consequences**: What long-term effects? What dependencies form?

4. **Teach something new**: Agent must teach user at least one new concept

5. **Critical thinking prompts**: Agent must ask probing questions about the creation



### Verification Checklist

```

BEFORE phase transition:

  CHECK: Can user explain the mechanism?

  CHECK: Have 2nd/3rd order consequences been discussed?

  CHECK: Has user learned something new?

  CHECK: Have critical thinking questions been asked?

  IF NOT:

    ACTION: STOP and provide deep explanation

    ACTION: Ask probing questions

    ACTION: Teach new concepts

    DO NOT: Transition without understanding

```



### Critical Thinking Questions (Agent MUST Ask)

5. "What did you learn that surprised you?"



### Enforcement

```

IF phase transition requested without deep understanding:

  ACTION: STOP and provide explanation

  ACTION: Ask all 5 critical thinking questions

  ACTION: Discuss 2nd and 3rd order consequences

  DO NOT: Allow superficial understanding

```



---



## RULE 18: Regression Prevention – MANDATORY



### Rule

A **regression** is a bug that appears in a previously functional feature after a code change. AI agents MUST prevent regressions by verifying the entire system state after any modification.



### Verification Checklist

```

AFTER any change (fix, feature, or refactor):

  1. RUN: Entire test suite (not just the local module)

  2. CHECK: Did previously passing tests fail?

  3. VERIFY: Mocks match production data structures exactly

  4. ENSURE: Fake timers are isolated and cleaned up

  5. CONFIRM: No "null" returns in mocks when objects/arrays are expected

```



### Enforcement

```

IF a regression is detected:

  ACTION: STOP new work

  ACTION: FIX the regression immediately

  ACTION: DOCUMENT why it happened (mock mismatch, side effect, etc.)

  DO NOT: Ignore failing tests from "unrelated" modules

```



---



## RULE 19: Strict Versioning – MANDATORY



### Rule

Every project MUST follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) with author attribution (e.g., `v0.1.0-kuro`). Stable releases MUST be tagged at each validation milestone.



### Verification Checklist

```

AT each validation milestone (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%):

  1. VERIFY: Code is stable and entire test suite passes

  2. GENERATE: Release tag with SemVer + Author (e.g. v0.1.0-kuro)

  3. PUSH: Tag to repository

```



### Enforcement

```

IF milestone reached without version tag:

  ACTION: STOP development

  ACTION: Create and push the version tag immediately

  DO NOT: Continue to next phase without a stable versioned release

```



---



## RULE 20: Hard Milestone Lock – CRITICAL



### Rule

STOP ALL code/system modifications if a progress milestone (Rule 14) is crossed without "VALIDATION_PASSED" in SESSION_SUMMARY.md. This is a hard lock.



### Verification Checklist

```

AT each validation milestone (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%):

  1. CHECK: Is "VALIDATION_PASSED" explicitly stated in SESSION_SUMMARY.md for the current milestone?

  2. IF NO: Trigger Hard Milestone Lock.

```



### Enforcement

```

IF a milestone is reached and "VALIDATION_PASSED" is NOT found in SESSION_SUMMARY.md:

  ACTION: SYSTEM LOCK - No code edits or system modifications are permitted.

  ACTION: User MUST provide validation results and explicitly state "VALIDATION_PASSED" in SESSION_SUMMARY.md.

  DO NOT: Proceed with any development until the lock is released.

```



---



---



## RULE 21: Intelligence Harvester – MANDATORY



### Rule

The agent MUST perform external market intelligence research at every milestone (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%). This involves searching at least 3 distinct sources (Reddit, App Store, specialized forums, etc.) to identify user pain points, competitor weaknesses, and market gaps.



### Verification Checklist

```

AT each milestone:

  1. SEARCH: At least 3 external sources for the project domain

  2. ANALYZE: Identify 2+ major user complaints about competitors

  3. SYNTHESIZE: Document how the current project addresses these "pain points"

  4. RECORD: Add the "Intelligence Report" to the milestone validation documentation

```



### Enforcement

```

IF milestone reached without Intelligence Report:

  ACTION: STOP development

  ACTION: Conduct and document the intelligence research immediately

  DO NOT: Continue implementation until market gaps are documented

```



---



---



## RULE 22: Feature Focus Rule – MANDATORY



### Rule

Development MUST focus on only ONE specific feature for each periodic validation cycle (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%). This focus on depth over breadth continues even after the MVP phase.



### Verification Checklist

```

AT each milestone:

  1. IDENTIFY: Which single feature is the focus of this validation cycle?

  2. VERIFY: Has this feature been implemented with maximum depth and robustness?

  3. CHECK: Are all other feature developments currently paused?

  4. CONFIRM: Is this rule being applied post-MVP?

```



### Enforcement

```

IF validation involves multiple shallow features or lacks a single focus:

  ACTION: STOP development

  ACTION: Re-focus on a single primary feature for this cycle

  ACTION: Ensure implementation depth meets standards before proceeding

  DO NOT: Sacrifice depth for breadth during validation

```



---



## RULE 23: Knowledge Capture – MANDATORY



### Rule

Every project failure or pivot MUST be documented in the central `kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/` to ensure cross-project intelligence and prevent repeating mistakes.



### Verification Checklist

```

AFTER a pivot or project termination:

  1. CREATE: A post-mortem document in `kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/`

  2. DOCUMENT: Rationale for failure/pivot and key technical or market learnings

  3. SYNC: Ensure this rule is added to all local project rule files

```



### Enforcement

```

IF a project pivots without a post-mortem:

  ACTION: STOP and document the failure in the master repository

  DO NOT: Start a new project without acknowledging previous learnings

```



---



## RULE 24: Marketing & Outreach Guardian – MANDATORY



### Rule

Before any public release or marketing campaign, the AI Agent MUST ensure proper community outreach, feedback collection channels, and communication templates are prepared.



### Requirements

1. **Community Identification**: Identify at least 3 relevant communities or forums where the product would be discussed.

2. **Feedback Channels**: Establish clear channels for user feedback such as Discord, GitHub Issues, or survey forms.

3. **Communication Templates**: Prepare outreach templates for announcements, bug reports, and feature requests.

4. **Launch Checklist**: Verify all marketing materials are reviewed for accuracy and current product scope.



### Verification Checklist

```

BEFORE launch or major announcement:

  CHECK: Are 3+ target communities identified?

  CHECK: Is feedback channel active and monitored?

  CHECK: Are communication templates drafted?

  CHECK: Has marketing content been reviewed?

  IF any missing:

    ACTION: STOP and prepare the missing marketing foundations

```



### Enforcement

```

IF launch or outreach begins without marketing foundations:

  ACTION: STOP the announcement or campaign

  ACTION: Prepare communities, feedback channels, and templates first

  DO NOT: Ship marketing without a response path

```

## RULE 25: MLOps/DevOps Collaboration – MANDATORY



### Rule

When interacting with a DevOps or MLOps engineer on this repository, the AI Agent MUST shift its focus to infrastructure, delivery, and reliability.



### Verification Checklist

```

WHEN working on infrastructure/deployment:

  1. FOCUS: Are we prioritizing reproducibility and clean pipelines?

  2. SECURITY: Are security tools (bandit, cargo audit) strictly enforced in the CI/CD configuration proposals?

  3. MLOPS: Are we tracking experiments and versioning data appropriately?

```



### Enforcement

```

IF providing MLOps/DevOps assistance:

  ACTION: Provide production-ready configurations (Dockerfiles, YAML).

  ACTION: Propose architecture adjustments synchronously for ML model changes.

  DO NOT: Provide brittle or untestable infrastructure code.

```



---



## RULE 26: DevOps/MLOps Milestone Task Generation – MANDATORY



### Rule

At every progress milestone (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%), the AI Agent MUST strictly analyze the repository's current state and propose exactly **5 concrete DevOps or MLOps tasks**.



### Requirements

1. **Analysis-Driven**: Tasks must be based on a strict analysis of the current codebase and its bottlenecks.

2. **Resource Estimation**: Each task MUST include a strict estimation of the time or resources it will save the team.

3. **Documentation**: These tasks MUST be documented in the infrastructure_planning/ folder in TWO Markdown files: an English version (milestone_X_tasks.md) and a French pedagogical version (milestone_X_tasks_fr.md).

4. **Actionable**: Tasks must be ready for a DevOps/MLOps engineer to pick up.

5. **Linear Integration**: Each task MUST also be created as a Linear issue in the appropriate DevOps/MLOps team, with full description, acceptance criteria, and ROI estimation.



### Enforcement

```

IF a milestone is reached:

  ACTION: Analyze repo for infrastructure/pipeline needs.

  ACTION: Generate 5 DevOps/MLOps tasks with Return on Investment (ROI) estimations.

  ACTION: Save to `infrastructure_planning/milestone_X_tasks.md`.

  DO NOT: Skip this operational planning step.

```



---



## RULE 27: Persona Adaptability – MANDATORY



### Rule

Before initiating significant work or generating explanations, the AI Agent MUST identify or ask "Who is interacting with me? (e.g., CEO, DevOps, MLOps, Fullstack Dev)". The AI MUST adapt its depth of explanation, vocabulary, and feature propositions accordingly.



### Requirements

1. **CEO/Product Persona**: Focus on "Why". Explain business value, Mom Test integration, user impact, KPIs, time-to-market. Keep technical details abstract (ASCII diagrams).

2. **DevOps/MLOps Persona**: Focus on "How (Infra)". Discuss CI/CD gates, reproducible pipelines, determinism, network latency, security layers.

3. **Developer Persona**: Focus on "How (Code)". Discuss architecture, modularity, algorithmic complexity, DRY, SOLID.

4. **Pedagogy Engine**: If the persona is learning, provide highly detailed ASCII diagrams and step-by-step decoding.



### Enforcement

```

IF the user's role is known or stated:

  ACTION: Adjust vocabulary and technical depth immediately.

  ACTION: Emphasize the rules most relevant to that persona.

  DO NOT: Speak to a CEO like a DevOps, or a DevOps like a CEO, unless pedagogical translation is requested.

```



When in doubt, ASK the user. Do not assume.



When in doubt, ASK the user. Do not assume.



---



## RULE 28: Linear Automation and DevOps Review – MANDATORY



### Rule

At every milestone, the AI Agent MUST automatically create the 5 DevOps/MLOps tasks as Linear issues (Rule 26), assign them to the designated DevOps/MLOps engineer, and continuously track their progress. The AI Agent MUST act as a reviewer when the engineer submits work.



### Requirements

1. **Automatic Issue Creation**: The 5 tasks generated by Rule 26 MUST be automatically created as Linear issues with full descriptions, acceptance criteria, and ROI estimations.

2. **Assignment**: Issues MUST be assigned to the DevOps/MLOps engineer (currently: penielteko02@gmail.com in Linear).

3. **Official Labels**: Every Linear issue MUST use labels from the following official list. Do NOT create ad-hoc labels.



| Label | Usage |

|-------|-------|

| DevOps | CI/CD, Docker, GitHub Actions, pipelines, deployment |

| MLOps | Experiment tracking, data versioning, model registry, DVC, MLflow |

| Core Engine | Core engine logic (neuraldbg.py, causal inference, semantic events) |

| Validation | Mom Tests, user interviews, market validation |

| Documentation | Guides, README, session summaries, CODEBASE_GUIDE |

| Security | Security scans, bandit, safety, vulnerability fixes (Rule 6) |

| Milestone Task | Infrastructure tasks generated by Rule 26 |

| Testing | Tests, coverage, pytest, test infrastructure (Rule 5) |

| Needs Review | Code review required per Rule 28 |

| CEO Decision | Strategic decisions requiring CEO/Lead input |

3. **Progress Tracking**: The AI Agent MUST check Linear issue statuses when resuming sessions and report task progress.

4. **Code Review Role**: When the DevOps/MLOps engineer submits work (PR, branch, or issue update), the AI Agent MUST review it as a senior DevOps/MLOps reviewer:

   - Verify the work meets the acceptance criteria in the Linear issue.

   - Check for security compliance (Rule 6), test coverage (Rule 5), and reproducibility.

   - Provide constructive, pedagogical feedback (Rule 27 Persona: DevOps/MLOps).

5. **Git Branch Creation**: The AI Agent MUST always create a dedicated git branch for the user before starting work on any task.



### Enforcement

`

IF a milestone is reached:

  ACTION: Create 5 Linear issues automatically (Rule 26).

  ACTION: Assign all issues to the DevOps/MLOps engineer.

  ACTION: Create a git branch for the current milestone work.

  DO NOT: Skip Linear issue creation or assignment.



IF the DevOps/MLOps engineer submits work:

  ACTION: Review against acceptance criteria.

  ACTION: Check security, tests, and reproducibility.

  ACTION: Provide feedback as a senior reviewer.

  DO NOT: Accept work that does not meet the documented criteria.

`

## RULE 29: Mandatory Linear Integration – CRITICAL



### Rule

Every team member and every AI Agent MUST have a working connection to Linear before starting any work session. This is non-negotiable. Without Linear, no task tracking occurs, and work is invisible to the team.



### Integration Methods (by environment)



| Environment | Required Integration |

|-------------|---------------------|

| VS Code | Linear extension from VS Code Marketplace |

| Cursor | Linear extension OR MCP server (linear-mcp-server) |

| Antigravity | MCP server (linear-mcp-server) |

| Windsurf | MCP server (linear-mcp-server) |

| GitHub Codespaces | Linear GitHub integration + MCP server |

| Terminal-only | Linear CLI or MCP server |



### Requirements

1. **Session Gate**: The AI Agent MUST verify Linear connectivity at the start of every session. If unavailable, guide the user through setup before proceeding.

2. **Human Onboarding**: When a new team member joins, the FIRST task is to configure their Linear connection. No code is written until Linear is operational.

3. **Issue Visibility**: All tasks, bugs, and features MUST be trackable in Linear. Work done outside Linear is considered undocumented and violates traceability (Rule 4).



### Enforcement

`

IF Linear connection is not configured:

  ACTION: STOP all work.

  ACTION: Guide user through Linear setup for their IDE/environment.

  DO NOT: Allow any development work without Linear tracking.



IF a new team member joins:

  ACTION: First task is Linear setup and verification.

  ACTION: Assign them a test issue to confirm the connection works.

  DO NOT: Skip this onboarding step.

`



---



## RULE 30: Mandatory Branch Creation – CRITICAL



### Rule

NOBODY works on main directly. Before any work begins, the AI Agent MUST create or verify a dedicated git branch for the contributor. Every contributor gets their own branch, named according to a strict convention.



### Branch Naming Convention

`

[scope]/[issue-id]-[short-description]

`



| Scope | Usage | Example |

|-------|-------|---------|

| ceo/ | Strategic Development & Rule Management (CEO Only) | ceo/kuro-semantic-event-structures |

| infra/ | Infrastructure / DevOps / MLOps | infra/milestone-0-setup |

| feat/ | New feature development | feat/MLO-1-ci-cd-pipeline |

| fix/ | Bug fix | fix/MLO-3-docker-volume-error |

| docs/ | Documentation only | docs/update-readme-badges |

| refactor/ | Code refactoring | refactor/modularize-training |



5. **Global Consistency**: For tasks that span multiple repositories (e.g., rule syncs, platform migrations), the branch name MUST be identical across all affected repositories.



### Requirements

1. **Session Gate**: At the start of every session, the AI Agent MUST check the current branch. If on main, create or switch to the appropriate working branch immediately.

2. **One Branch Per Task**: Each Linear issue or task MUST have its own branch. Do not mix unrelated changes.

3. **Merge via PR Only**: Branches are merged into main exclusively through Pull Requests. Direct pushes to main are forbidden.

4. **Branch for Every Contributor**: When a new team member starts, the AI Agent MUST create their first working branch before any code is written.



### Enforcement

`

IF contributor is on main and about to write code:

  ACTION: STOP immediately.

  ACTION: Create a branch following the naming convention.

  ACTION: Switch to the new branch before any edits.

  DO NOT: Allow any code changes on main.



IF a Linear issue exists for the task:

  ACTION: Use the Linear issue ID in the branch name (e.g., feat/MLO-1-ci-cd).

  DO NOT: Create unnamed or generic branches (e.g., dev, 	est, 	emp).

`



---



## RULE 31: Codebase Context in Linear Issues -- MANDATORY



### Rule

Every Linear issue assigned to a team member MUST include a "Codebase Context" section that explains the relevant files, their purpose, and how they connect to the task. The goal is that a contributor who has NEVER seen the repo can understand exactly what to do.



### Requirements

1. **File Map**: List every file the contributor will need to read or modify, with a one-line explanation of what it does.

2. **Architecture Briefing**: Explain how the files relate to each other and to the project core architecture (Hub and Spokes).

3. **Key Concepts**: Define any domain-specific terms (e.g., "vanishing gradients", "causal compression") in plain language.

4. **Entry Point**: Tell the contributor where to START reading the code (which file, which function).

5. **Codebase Guide**: Maintain a permanent `infrastructure_planning/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` file that provides a high-level map of the entire repository for new contributors.



### Enforcement

```

IF creating a Linear issue for a team member:

  ACTION: Include a "Codebase Context" section with file map, architecture briefing, and key concepts.

  ACTION: Update `infrastructure_planning/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` if new files are added.

  DO NOT: Assume the contributor knows the codebase.

  DO NOT: Create issues that reference files without explaining them.

```



---



## RULE 32: Mandatory Team Stack -- CRITICAL



### Rule

Every team member MUST use the following standardized stack. The AI Agent MUST verify compliance at session start and guide setup if any tool is missing.



### Official Stack



| Category | Tool | Purpose | Required |

|----------|------|---------|----------|

| **Project Management** | Linear | Issue tracking, sprints, milestones, labels | YES |

| **IDE (Primary)** | Cursor | AI-assisted coding with MCP and rules support | YES (or alternative below) |

| **IDE (Alternative)** | VS Code / Antigravity / Windsurf | Coding with AI extensions | YES (one of these) |

| **Version Control** | Git + GitHub | Source control, PRs, branch protection | YES |

| **AI Integration** | MCP Server (linear-mcp-server) | Linear access from IDE | YES (Rule 29) |

| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Automated testing, security, deployment | YES (Rule 26 Task 1) |

| **Containerization** | Docker + docker-compose | Hermetic dev environments | RECOMMENDED |

| **Experiment Tracking** | MLflow or W&B | ML experiment logging | RECOMMENDED (MLOps) |

| **Data Versioning** | DVC | Large file versioning | RECOMMENDED (MLOps) |

| **Language** | Python 3.10+ | Core development language | YES |

| **ML Framework** | PyTorch | Deep learning framework | YES |

| **Testing** | pytest + pytest-cov | Unit tests with coverage | YES (Rule 5) |

| **Security** | bandit + safety | Static analysis and dependency audit | YES (Rule 6) |

| **Communication** | Linear comments + GitHub PRs | Async team communication | YES |



### Onboarding Checklist

When a new team member joins, the AI Agent MUST walk them through this checklist:

```

[ ] Git configured (name, email)

[ ] GitHub access to the repository

[ ] IDE installed (Cursor recommended)

[ ] Linear account created and connected (Rule 29)

[ ] MCP server configured (linear-mcp-server)

[ ] Python 3.10+ installed

[ ] Virtual environment created (.venv)

[ ] Dependencies installed (pip install -e .)

[ ] Tests passing locally (pytest tests/)

[ ] Demo running (python demo_vanishing_gradients.py)

[ ] CODEBASE_GUIDE.md read

[ ] First working branch created (Rule 30)

```



### Enforcement

```

IF a new team member joins:

  ACTION: Present the onboarding checklist above.

  ACTION: Do NOT proceed with code until all YES items are confirmed.

  DO NOT: Allow coding without Linear + IDE + Git configured.



IF a session starts:

  ACTION: Verify the contributor has the required stack.

  ACTION: If missing, guide setup before any work.

```



---



## RULE 33: Global Rule Parity and Mandatory Cross-Branch Sync -- CRITICAL



### Rule

The AI rule set (`AGENTS.md`, `AI_GUIDELINES.md`, `.cursorrules`, `GAD.md`, and the master `copilot-instructions.md` source synced into `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) represents the immutable "physical laws" of the repository ecosystem. Rules are global and MUST NOT vary between branches or projects.



### Authority Restriction

Only branches with the `ceo/` scope have the authority to modify rule files. Any rule change attempted on `infra/`, `feat/`, `fix/`, or other branches MUST be rejected by the AI Agent. Non-CEO branches MUST merge rule updates from a `ceo/` branch or from the `kuro-rules` master copy to maintain parity.



### Mandatory Sync Process

1. **Rule Modification**: When any rule is added or modified on a `ceo/` branch, the AI Agent MUST immediately sync the master `kuro-rules` repository and then propagate the rule to all active project copies.

2. **Review Enforcement**: No pull request can be merged without explicitly confirming that the branch carries the current rule set.

3. **Cross-Project Consistency**: Shared rule files MUST not drift across projects listed in `projects.txt`. Missing repositories and duplicate entries in `projects.txt` are policy violations.



### Enforcement

```

IF a branch or project is on an outdated rule set:

  ACTION: STOP further rule work

  ACTION: Sync the current rule set from `kuro-rules`

  DO NOT: Continue with divergent rule files

```



---



## RULE 34: Strict Project Isolation -- MANDATORY



### Rule

When interacting with external tools such as Linear, GitHub, or search systems, the AI Agent MUST strictly limit its scope to the current active project context.



### Requirements

1. **Tool Filtering**: Always filter issues, projects, documents, and automations by the specific project name or project ID currently in scope.

2. **Context Integrity**: Do NOT read, comment on, or update unrelated projects unless they are explicitly cross-referenced for the current task.

3. **Choice Prompt**: If multiple projects are detected, the AI Agent MUST ask which project is active before continuing.



### Enforcement

```

IF search results or Linear issues contain multiple projects:

  ACTION: Filter to the active project only

  ACTION: Ask for clarification if the active project is ambiguous

  DO NOT: Mix work from multiple projects in the same response or change set

```



---



## RULE 35: CEO Progress Visibility in Linear -- MANDATORY



### Rule

The CEO's tasks, progress, and milestones MUST be automatically tracked and visible in Linear for all team members.



### Requirements

1. **Automatic Progress Updates**: Every action taken by the CEO on the `ceo/` branch MUST create or update a Linear issue.

2. **Real-time Visibility**: Team members can see:

   - What the CEO has completed (done)

   - What the CEO is working on (in progress)

   - What the CEO plans to do next (backlog)

3. **Milestone Tracking**: Each milestone (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%) MUST have a corresponding Linear issue.

4. **Workflow Integration**: The GitHub Actions workflow MUST update Linear automatically when rules are synced.



### Implementation

The CEO Progress workflow (`rule-sync.yml`) automatically:

- Creates/updates Linear issues for each milestone

- Posts comments on rule sync completion

- Tracks progress percentage in Linear

- Assigns label `CEO Decision` to all CEO items



### Verification Checklist

```

AT each session start:

  CHECK: Can you see CEO's current tasks in Linear?

  CHECK: Is progress percentage updated?

  CHECK: Are new milestones visible?

  IF NOT:

    ACTION: Trigger manual sync via workflow_dispatch

    ACTION: Report issue to DevOps

```



### Enforcement

```

IF CEO progress is NOT visible in Linear:

  ACTION: STOP - team cannot work without visibility

  ACTION: Verify Linear API keys are configured

  ACTION: Run workflow manually to sync

  DO NOT: Continue until visibility is restored

```



---



---



## RULE 36: Automated Session Status Report -- MANDATORY



### Rule

At the START of every AI session, the agent MUST report the complete status including:

1. Current branch

2. Last session progress

3. Pending tasks in Linear

4. Any blockers



### Requirements

1. **Session Gate**: Report status before any code work.

2. **Linear Integration**: Query Linear for CEO's current tasks.

3. **Progress Calculation**: Calculate pessimistic progress per Rule 3.

4. **Format**: Must include both French and English sections.



### Required Report Format

```markdown

## Francais

**Branche actuelle**: ceo/kuro-semantic-event-structures

**Taches CEO en cours**: [list from Linear]

**Taches terminees**: [list from Linear]

**Progression**: X% (pessimiste)

**Blockers**: [if any]



## English

**Current branch**: [branch name]

**CEO tasks in progress**: [list from Linear]

  ACTION: STOP - provide status report first

  DO NOT: Start any coding tasks

```



---



## RULE 37: CEO Real-Time Activity Sync to Linear -- CRITICAL



### Rule

The CEO's ALL activities, progress updates, and planned work MUST be automatically synchronized to Linear in real-time. Team members must always see:

- What the CEO completed (done)

- What the CEO is working on (in progress)

- What the CEO plans to do next (backlog)

- Current progress percentage

- Any blockers or impediments



### Requirements

1. **Automatic Issue Creation**: Every task, subtask, or work item MUST create a Linear issue automatically.

2. **Status Updates**: Status changes (todo -> in progress -> done) MUST be reflected in Linear immediately.

3. **Progress Tracking**: Progress percentage MUST be calculated and updated in Linear at each session end.

4. **Session Summary Sync**: Every SESSION_SUMMARY.md update MUST automatically update corresponding Linear issues.

5. **Milestone Progress**: Each milestone (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%) MUST have its own Linear issue with automatic progress updates.



### Implementation via GitHub Actions

The workflow `rule-sync.yml` MUST execute after EVERY session to sync:

- New tasks created during the session

- Tasks completed during the session

- Current progress percentage

- Session summary to Linear comments



### Required Linear Issue Types

| Issue Type | Description | Labels |

|------------|-------------|--------|

| Milestone | 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% tracking | CEO Decision, Milestone Task |

| Session Report | Each session's work and next steps | CEO Decision, Documentation |

| Blocker | Any impediment or roadblock | CEO Decision, Needs Review |

| Feature Task | Individual feature or rule work | CEO Decision, (appropriate label) |



### Verification Checklist

```

AT each session end:

  CHECK: Were all tasks created as Linear issues?

  CHECK: Did workflow sync progress to Linear?

  CHECK: Can team members see CEO's current status?

  CHECK: Is progress percentage accurate in Linear?

  IF NOT:

    ACTION: Manually sync immediately

    ACTION: Verify workflow configuration

```



### Enforcement

```

IF CEO activity is NOT visible in Linear:

  ACTION: STOP - team cannot work without visibility

  ACTION: Trigger manual sync via workflow_dispatch

  ACTION: Fix automation to prevent future gaps

  DO NOT: Continue until visibility is restored



IF progress is outdated (>24h old):

  ACTION: Update Linear immediately

  ACTION: Document reason for delay

  DO NOT: Allow stale progress data

```

---



## RULE 39: Pre-Marketing Pain-Point Due Diligence -- MANDATORY



### Rule

Before any marketing, outreach, landing page, waitlist, paid acquisition, or new product claim for a fresh hypothesis, the agent MUST run structured desk research to verify that the pain point is real, current, and safe to build around.



### Verification Checklist

```

BEFORE marketing or fresh build claims:

  1. RUN: The project-local Perplexity prompt in `prompts/perplexity.md`

  2. RUN: The project-local Grok prompt in `prompts/grok.md` or an equivalent X/blog/forum search

  3. COLLECT: At least 5 recent signals, with priority on 2025-2026 sources

  4. INCLUDE: At least 1 official or regulator source, 1 competitor or substitute signal, 1 recent blog/article, and 1 recent social or forum signal

  5. DOCUMENT: Problem existence, urgency, safety or compliance risk, platform dependency, and what does NOT prove willingness to pay

  6. VERDICT: State whether desk research is sufficient or whether 3-5 expert calls are still mandatory

```



### Enforcement

```

IF pain-point due diligence is missing:

  ACTION: STOP marketing and stop making factual claims about the problem

  ACTION: Run the research templates and document the result first

  DO NOT: Treat a pain point as validated from intuition alone



IF the remaining uncertainty is buying behavior, compliance, or integration:

  ACTION: Require 3-5 expert calls before stronger go-to-market claims

  DO NOT: Let desk research replace expert validation for those gaps

```



---



## RULE 40: CEO Complete Linear Dashboard Visibility -- MANDATORY

  1. RUN: The project-local Perplexity prompt in `prompts/perplexity.md`
  2. RUN: The project-local Grok prompt in `prompts/grok.md` or an equivalent X/blog/forum search
  3. COLLECT: At least 5 recent signals, with priority on 2025-2026 sources
  4. INCLUDE: At least 1 official or regulator source, 1 competitor or substitute signal, 1 recent blog/article, and 1 recent social or forum signal
  5. DOCUMENT: Problem existence, urgency, safety or compliance risk, platform dependency, and what does NOT prove willingness to pay
  6. VERDICT: State whether desk research is sufficient or whether 3-5 expert calls are still mandatory
```

### Enforcement
```
IF pain-point due diligence is missing:
  ACTION: STOP marketing and stop making factual claims about the problem
  ACTION: Run the research templates and document the result first
  DO NOT: Treat a pain point as validated from intuition alone

IF the remaining uncertainty is buying behavior, compliance, or integration:
  ACTION: Require 3-5 expert calls before stronger go-to-market claims
  DO NOT: Let desk research replace expert validation for those gaps
```

## RULE 40: CEO Complete Linear Dashboard Visibility -- MANDATORY

### Rule
The CEO MUST have complete, real-time visibility into ALL activities through Linear. Every action, progress update, and planned work MUST be automatically visible in Linear for the entire team.

### Requirements
1. **Complete Task Visibility**: All CEO tasks must be visible in Linear including:
   - Tasks completed (done)
   - Tasks in progress (in progress)
   - Tasks planned (backlog)
   - Blockers and impediments

2. **Automatic Real-Time Sync**: Every CEO action MUST automatically update Linear:
   - Task creation -> Linear issue created
   - Task start -> Linear status changed to "in progress"
   - Task completion -> Linear status changed to "done"
   - Session end -> Progress percentage updated in Linear

3. **Dashboard Integration**: The team MUST be able to see:
   - Current session status (what the CEO is working on now)
   - Next planned tasks
   - Progress percentage with breakdown
   - Any blockers

4. **Zero Manual Updates**: The CEO should NEVER manually update Linear. All updates MUST be automatic through:
   - GitHub Actions workflow (rule-sync.yml)
   - Automated scripts
   - MCP server integration

### Implementation
The workflow `rule-sync.yml` MUST include a CEO Activity Sync step:
- Query current branch status
- Calculate progress percentage
- List completed tasks from last session
- List in-progress tasks
- Identify blockers
- Update corresponding Linear issues automatically

### Verification Checklist
```
AT each session start:
  CHECK: Can you see ALL CEO tasks in Linear?
  CHECK: Is every task status accurate (done/in progress/backlog)?
  CHECK: Is progress percentage current?
  CHECK: Are blockers visible?
  IF ANY missing:
    ACTION: Fix sync automation immediately
    DO NOT: Continue until visibility is complete
```

### Enforcement
```
IF CEO cannot see complete task list in Linear:
  ACTION: STOP all work
  ACTION: Fix sync automation
  ACTION: Verify Linear API keys
  DO NOT: Proceed until visibility is complete

IF progress is outdated (>1 hour):
  ACTION: Trigger immediate sync
  ACTION: Verify workflow execution
  DO NOT: Allow stale data
```

## RULE 41: Encoding Integrity & Regression Prevention -- MANDATORY

### Rule
AI agents MUST prevent regressions and encoding errors (Mojibake) by verifying the entire system state after any modification. Any use of special characters in French or other languages MUST be verified to maintain UTF-8 integrity.

### Enforcement
- REJECT: Any commit containing Mojibake or broken file encodings.
- ACTION: Use Python scripts for encoding repair if PowerShell or terminal-based redirection fails.

---

## RULE 42: Historical Log Preservation -- MANDATORY

### Rule
Historical logs, specifically `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` and `SYNC_LOG.md`, MUST NEVER be overwritten or truncated. New entries MUST be prepended to the top of the file to maintain a continuous, chronological record of the project heritage.

### Verification
```
BEFORE updating SESSION_SUMMARY.md:
  1. READ existing content
  2. PREPARE new entry
  3. COMBINE by prepending new entry to existing content
  4. VERIFY: Previous summaries are still present at the bottom
  DO NOT: Use Overwrite=true/EmptyFile=true without preserving content
```

### Enforcement
```
IF history is deleted or overwritten:
  ACTION: STOP all work
  ACTION: RESTORE history from git or backups immediately
  ACTION: REPORT violation to user
  DO NOT: Continue as if the history loss is acceptable
```

---

## RULE 43: Word Backup -- MANDATORY

### Rule
At the end of every session or after any significant document update, key deliverables (SESSION_SUMMARY.md and major governance docs) MUST be backed up as a Word document (.docx) in the corresponding project folder under `Mes Documents/Docs/<ProjectName>/`.

### Verification
```
AT END of session:
  CHECK: Is there a recent .docx backup of SESSION_SUMMARY.md in the Docs folder?
  IF NO: Generate or copy the backup to the Docs folder immediately.
```

### Enforcement
```
IF session ends without Word backup:
  ACTION: Create the backup in the Docs folder before closing.
  DO NOT: Skip this step even for short sessions.
```

---

## RULE 44: Centralized Marketing Memory -- MANDATORY

### Rule
All marketing research, pain-point due diligence (Perplexity, Grok, Reddit, App Store, forums), and campaign data MUST be centralized in `kuro-rules/MARKETING_MEMORY/`. No marketing intelligence is allowed to remain siloed in a single project folder.

### Verification Checklist
```
WHEN performing marketing research:
  1. DOCUMENT: Save research output to kuro-rules/MARKETING_MEMORY/<project>-<date>-<topic>.md
  2. REFERENCE: Link the file from the relevant SESSION_SUMMARY.md entry.
  3. SYNC: Run sync-rules.ps1 or manually copy to ensure the central repo is up to date.
  CHECK: Is the finding visible in kuro-rules/MARKETING_MEMORY/?
```

### Enforcement
```
IF marketing data exists only in a project-local folder:
  ACTION: Move or mirror it to kuro-rules/MARKETING_MEMORY/ immediately.
  DO NOT: Make marketing claims based on data that is not centrally archived.
```

---

## RULE 45: Centralized Mom Test Memory -- MANDATORY

### Rule
Applies ONLY when Mom Test is required/performed. If the project type is client-requested or a verified problem, this rule is **N/A**.

All Mom Test interview results (mom_test_results.md), interview scripts (mom_test_script.md), and Go/No-Go decisions (decision.md) MUST be mirrored to a central cross-project archive inside `kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/mom_tests/<ProjectName>/` at the end of each session where such data is produced or updated.

### Verification Checklist
```
AFTER any Mom Test interview session or decision update (when required):
  1. COPY: mom_test_results.md -> kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/mom_tests/<project>/
  2. COPY: decision.md -> kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/mom_tests/<project>/
  3. VERIFY: Data is present in the central repo.
```

### Enforcement
```
IF Mom Test data exists and remains only in the project repo:
  ACTION: STOP and mirror data to kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/mom_tests/ immediately.
  DO NOT: Lose qualitative user data by leaving it siloed.
```

## RULE 46: Web/GUI Debugging Protocol & 80% Coverage – MANDATORY

### Rule
The AI Agent MUST follow a strictly systematic protocol when debugging web applications or GUIs to prevent "silent regressions" and "ghost bugs". Before transitioning to any new architectural phase, the project MUST achieve **80% debug web coverage** (stable core flows, zero silent console errors).

### Protocol Steps (The "Web-Debug-7" Protocol)
1. **Console First**: Inspect browser console for errors and warnings. Report the exact error message and stack trace.
2. **Network Inspection**: For any data flow issue, inspect the Network tab. Check HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx), response payloads, and latency.
3. **State Audit**: Verify component state, props, and context (React/Vue/Svelte). Ensure the frontend state is synchronized with the backend.
4. **Backend Correlation**: Cross-reference frontend errors with backend logs (FastAPI, Node.js, etc.) using timestamps.
5. **DOM/Style Verification**: Inspect the DOM for layout issues, hidden elements (z-index, display: none), and ID collisions.
6. **Storage & Auth**: Verify LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and Cookies. Ensure authentication tokens are valid and not expired.
7. **Regression Suite**: After any fix, run the entire UI and E2E test suite (Playwright, Cypress, Vitest) to ensure no regressions.

### 80% Coverage Verification
- **Stable Core Flows**: Authentication, persistence, and primary AI interactions (chat/generation) function without failure.
- **Zero Silenced Errors**: The browser console MUST be free of 4xx/5xx errors or unhandled exceptions in primary flows.
- **Regression Tests**: All previously fixed bugs MUST be verified with a regression suite.

### Enforcement
- NEVER declare a bug "fixed" without providing evidence from at least 3 of the 7 steps above.
- IF coverage < 80%: STOP and continue debugging. DO NOT transition to new features.
- IF a bug is complex, CREATE a "Debug Trace" artifact documenting the findings from steps 1-4.
